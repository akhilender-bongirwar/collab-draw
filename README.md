### What I Learned

During the development of Collab Draw, I gained hands-on experience in utilizing TypeScript for frontend development. Working with Redux Toolkit for structured state management was a key learning point. Additionally, integrating Socket.io for real-time collaboration enhanced my understanding of WebSocket communication in web applications.
